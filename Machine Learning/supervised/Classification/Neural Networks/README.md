<h2><a href="">What are Neural Networks:</a></h2>

<p>Neural networks are set of algorithms inspired by the functioning of human brian.
Generally when you open your eyes, what you see is called data and is processed by the
Nuerons(data processing cells) in your brain, and recognises what is around you. That’s
how similar the Neural Networks works. They takes a large set of data, process the data
(draws out the patterns from data), and outputs what it is.
</p><br><br>



<h2><a href="">What do they do:</a></h2>
<p>Neural networks sometimes called as Artificial Neural networks(ANN’s), because they are
not natural like neurons in your brain. They artifically mimic the nature and funtioning of
Neural network. ANN’s are composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing
elements (neurones) working in unison to solve specific problems.
</p>
<p>
ANNs, like people,like child, they even learn by example. An ANN is configured for a specific
application, such as pattern recognition or data classification,Image recognition, voice recognition through a learning process.
</p>
<p>
Neural networks (NN) are universal function approximaters so that means neural networks can learn an approximation of any function y = f(x) such that.
